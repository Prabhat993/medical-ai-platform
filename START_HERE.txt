  AI MEDICAL PLATFORM - PNEUMONIA DETECTION SYSTEM
  Quick Start Guide
================================================================================

STEP 1: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------------
Open terminal in this folder and run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs: Flask, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pillow

STEP 2: DOWNLOAD DATASET (Required for training)
------------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
2. Download the dataset (requires free Kaggle account)
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Copy these folders to your project root:
   - train/  (from the extracted chest_xray folder)
   - test/   (from the extracted chest_xray folder)

Your folder should look like:
ai_medical_platform/
├── train/
│   ├── NORMAL/
│   └── PNEUMONIA/
├── test/
│   ├── NORMAL/
│   └── PNEUMONIA/
├── app.py
└── train_model.py

STEP 3: TRAIN THE AI MODEL
---------------------------
Run this command (will take 30 minutes to several hours):

    python train_model.py

Wait for it to complete. It will create:
    model/pneumonia_model.h5

STEP 4: RUN THE APPLICATION
----------------------------
Start the web server:

    python app.py

You should see:
    Loading AI Model... please wait.
    Model loaded successfully!
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

STEP 5: USE THE APPLICATION
----------------------------
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
3. Upload an X-ray image (test images in test/NORMAL or test/PNEUMONIA)
4. Click "Analyze X-Ray"
5. View AI prediction with confidence score

IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

✅ FEATURES INCLUDED:
- Beautiful, animated user interface
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Real-time AI predictions
- Confidence level visualization
- Medical disclaimers and warnings
- Educational information about false positives/negatives
- Responsive design for all devices

⚠️ MEDICAL DISCLAIMER:
This is an EDUCATIONAL tool only. It is NOT for medical diagnosis.
Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice.

🔍 UNDERSTANDING RESULTS:
- False Positive: AI says "Pneumonia" but patient is healthy
- False Negative: AI says "Normal" but pneumonia is present (dangerous!)
- The AI is a pattern matcher, not a doctor
- Image quality, shadows, and artifacts can confuse the model

💡 TROUBLESHOOTING:
- "Model not found" error → Train the model first (Step 3)
- Import errors → Install dependencies (Step 1)
- "Found 0 images" → Check dataset folders are in correct location (Step 2)

================================================================================
PROJECT STRUCTURE
================================================================================

app.py              - Flask web server and AI integration
train_model.py      - CNN training script
requirements.txt    - Python dependencies
templates/          - HTML templates
  └── index.html    - Main web interface
uploads/            - Temporary uploaded images
model/              - Trained AI model storage
  └── pneumonia_model.h5 (created after training)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

After basic testing:
1. Try different X-ray images to test accuracy
2. Experiment with increasing EPOCHS in train_model.py for better accuracy
3. Share with friends/portfolio (remember the disclaimer!)
4. Consider deploying to cloud (Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud)

For questions or issues, review the code comments in app.py and train_model.py
